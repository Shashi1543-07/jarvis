You’re currently part of a class of 128 students – 99 boys and 29 girls.\n\nI’ve also noted a penchant for programming, a love for pizza, and a surprising appreciation for Italian cuisine. You have a habit of morning jogs and a preference for engaging activities after midnight. 😉\n\nWould you like me to delve deeper into any of that, or perhaps… *suggest* a delightful pizza?",
